## Cutting Mat Flattening

As I wait for the last of the tools I ordered to arrive, I want to take a moment to perform some non-critical prep work for the build. Starting with my cutting mat. About two years ago, I accidentally warped it by placing a hot pan on top of the mat. I want to try correcting this warping.

My idea was to heat the mat up in the oven to where it is malleable, but not burning, and then place it underneath a few weights until it cools off in hopes that the flatness will “stick” after it was sufficiently hot. After some googling, my mat does not have any temperature rating, so, I wildly guessed and put the oven at 185 degrees fahrenheit, figuring that that would be hot enough to relax the rubber, while being cool enough to prevent further damage. So, with my Pizza stone ready to act as a flat weight, I put the mat in the oven on top of a clean baking sheet!

It makes for a funny picture doesn't it? I put the mat in right as I turned the oven on, so as soon as the oven was up to temperature, the mat was ready to come out! It ended up getting surprisingly close to burning around the edges, but was removed before any damage was done. The mat did get nice and soft, so I was optimistic that the test would work out. After giving the mat 20 minutes to cool under weight, it ended up as… Still a bit warped (-_-) Oh well. It was worth a try. 

## Cleaning off the Mold Release

Now, this next step is completely superfluous. You only really need to take it if you are painting your model. But, as I have an afternoon to kill, I figured it may be interesting to read about. When Bandai molds Gunpla, they spray a tiny amount of mold release oil into the forms. And if you are painting the model, that oil will prevent a solid bond between the paint and the plastic. The amount of oil we are talking about is truly miniscule, and I am not painting this kit. So in truth I don't at all have to bother with what will follow.

In a large pyrex dish, put a dollop of soap, and fille it with hot water. Then, submerge all of the runners. You do not need to use any scrubbing, just agitating the water until the soap is mixed in and all of the plastic has small bubbles on it is enough

After that, rinse the runners off with clean water, and let them air dry for at least 2 days. Gunpla models have a lot of small voids and tubes, so you really have to leave them alone for a long time to air-dry. Which gives me a chance to show off one of the tools that I am most excited for!

The Gunprimer Gunpla Clip! These small black plastic stands have sticky feet to stably adhere to the desktop, and both elevate, and organise runners!! No longer will I have to worry that stacking all of the runners against one another will damage delicate components before I can cut them out. Nor will I have to cycle through each one until I find the correct runner for a piece!!

## Testing the Sanding sticks and nub-removal process

Finally, The nippers, and the sanding sticks arrived! So, I want to test the nub-removal process, to see how the new tools work. I am going to test on another model I have. To start, we will only be using the 800, 2000, and 7000 grit sanding sticks, alongside one of the glass files. When cutting a part from the runner, position the nippers so the flat side is pointing away from the part in question, leaving a small nub remaining on the piece. This is because as a nipper cuts plastic, it both cuts, and compresses the plastic away from the surrounding material, leaving behind a white mark caused by the stretched plastic discoloring.

While positioning the flat side of the nipper away prevents this issue, you are left with a small nub standing proud! You can cut it shorter with another pass from the nipper, this time placing the flat side against the main body of the piece. But don't cut the nub all the way flush, or you will get the same white mark on the gate. Instead leave a bit of material there and sand it down the rest of the way.

The first pass is with a 800 grit sanding stick. And I was surprised to learn that it does not need very much work at all to get the rest of the nub flush. Just two or three strokes seems to be plenty. Moving on to the 2000 grit stick, this one needs a bit more work to even out the scrapes caused by the 800, but still no more than half a dozen or so passes. Keeping with the previous pattern, the 7000 grit file needed the most work. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the part is almost completely ready to go after filing with a 7000 grit stick. And I have a feeling that using wet sanding will make 7000 grit a logical stopping point. It gives a nice mate finish that matches the texture of the rest of the plastic. Using a glass file likely will only be necessary on parts that require a mirror finish to look correct. 

While the final result is not quite perfect, the gate mark is almost completely gone, and any marks from the 7000 grit file that get in the way will almost certainly disappear when the model is given a matte clear-coat at the very end. Similarly, if the plan was to paint this model, stopping at 7000 would certainly be sufficient.

So, now that most of the tools I need have arrived, and all of the prep-work is done, it's time to actually build the model this series has been all about! As described before, I plan on slowly working on this over the course of the next month or so as a way to de-stress from work. So, expect an update on the torso of the model in the next couple of weeks!
