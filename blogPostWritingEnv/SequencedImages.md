I also want the ability to show photos with a post, but do it in such a way where they are rendered alongside text! For an example, here is a photo of my rendition for the matching tatoo i am going to get alongside my sisters:

the issue is things can get difficult when you are dealing with multiple photos! Creating a system to ensure they are ordered correctly was important to me. below, is a photo of the tatoos i want to get on my clavicles.

*If those were not ordered correctly... let me know ><

I will go into the ethos of my tatoo designes in much greater length another day, this is just a post to showcase my blogs capability to show in-text images.
