## This is a showcase of a post containing one or more videos:

Some things, like mechanical systems, or complex pieces of art really need a short video to explain them best. So, i knew early on that i wanted to include the ablity to embedd a video in any given post! This also happens to create a more engageing blog to read! 

The first video is of a rotary engine's combustion cycle, this suddenly became very important to me, as i recently bought a 2009 Mazda RX8.

I expect this to be rare, but i may want to embedd more than one video at a time! so, they sould always be shown in the correct order, just like with photos. So, here is a similar video depicting a piston engines combustion cycle.
