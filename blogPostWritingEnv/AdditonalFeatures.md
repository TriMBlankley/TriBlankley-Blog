Any good blogger should cite their sources! Here is an embedded Hyperlink: [Toyota MR2 Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_MR2)

Also, i wanted the ability to embedd photos in the post itself, but do it in such a way where they are rendered alongside text! For an example, here is a photo of one of the tatoo designs i am working on:

the issue is things can get difficult when you are dealing with multiple photos! Creating a system to ensure they are ordered correctly was important to me. below, is a photo of my Fiio M21, my current digital audio player!

And finally, i wanted to be able to upload large files! This is both so readers can pull them down and use them if they are so inclined, while also being a way to add documentation to important files i am working on or with at any given time. Large files are always displayed at the bottom of the page, and are not embedded in the markdown text.

For an examplel here is a 3d file of the bedside table i am working on building, I have hit a roadblock as our home router has proven rather unreliable, and will need to get it cut at another location.
