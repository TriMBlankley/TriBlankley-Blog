Any good blogger should cite their sources! To make it easy, embedded hyperlinks are preffered to maintain readability. Here is an example: [Toyota MR2 Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_MR2)

I also wanted the ability to show photos with a post, but do it in such a way where they are rendered alongside text! For an example, here is a photo of one of the tatoo designs i am working on:

[Sister Solidarity Bnuuy!](image1)

the issue is things can get difficult when you are dealing with multiple photos! Creating a system to ensure they are ordered correctly was important to me. below, is a photo of my Fiio M21, my current digital audio player!

*If those were not ordered correctly... let me know ><

And finally, i wanted to be able to upload large files! This is both so readers can pull them down and use them if they are so inclined, while also being a way to add documentation to important files i am working on or with at any given time. Large files are always displayed at the bottom of the page, and are not embedded in the markdown text.

For an example, here is the kicad file of the custom keyboard PCB i designed for Mando!
