One of the goals i had when creating this blog, is to make it very easy to pull the content of the post down, and not have to worry about how it will be rendered, or if the actual content will be lost in a sea of rendering artifacts. With this in mind, i decided to write all of the post's content in a .md markown file, allowing for rich-text to be added to a posts content, without it being overly intrusive from the perspective if the one writing the post, or the one pulling the posts data down for recovery or future reference.

When a post does not contain any pictures, or is very text-focused, it will display a large T on the post's icon from the home page.

Below are examples of the text-formatting offered in markdown:

For all headings put a new line before, and after the header.

# H1

## H2

### H3


Alternative text types:
*italic text*
**bold text**
***Bold and Italic***


> blockquote
>
>> Nested blockquote


Ordered List:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item


Unordered List:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item


Horizontal Rule: This needs a line before, and after.
