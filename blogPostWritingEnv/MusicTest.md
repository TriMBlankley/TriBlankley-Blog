## This is a showcase of a post with audio files

Later on, i hope to share my thoughts on audiofile equipment, create video-games, or talk on other sounds in my life, such as a cars exhaust tone. To this end i want to be able to embedd several audio files in the text for the reader to listen to, this post showcases that fuctionality.

When a post contains an audio file, it can be shown by containing a music note on the posts icon from the home page.
