First and foremost, who is the target-audience for my blog? In truth, the primary audience is myself. One of the core goals i had when creating this bog would be the ability to write about the process i have been taking with any given endeavor. This blog is intended to act as a kind of self-diologue as i talk though and large changes, important discoeries, or interesting occureces i found while workon on any hobby. One of the aspects i have always struggled with when writing code, is documenting what the higher-level funtion is tryting to do. There have been many times that i have gone back and seiad "What the hell is this function for? I can see what it does, and where it is used, but i cannot rememebr why i created it in the first place" This blog is intened to be a repository of higher-order documentation, not only showing the why of any given project, but also the challenges i faced and learned through.

The other audience is my immediate friends and family. Especialy with the hobbies more closely related to fine art, there are many aspects that can be extrememly difficult to communicate in a short conversation, while still being (in my opinion at least) both interesting, and intrinsic to the item in quiestion. An example of this is the new gunpla kit my sister got for me. This kit is entirely made of transparent plastic, which creates several challenges when preparing each peice before assembly. I want to be able to document this process, both becasue it is interesting, but also, as my goal will be that the documentation can act as either a tutorial, or guide of what not to do for similar projects that may happen in the future.
