I wanted to be able to store large files on the blog, in such a way where a user is easily able to pull the file down for their own use. Files, or any other attachments are stored at the bottom of the blog-page. To showcase this functionality, here is the soldworks file i am working on tht will hold the case of a custom keyboard I have been working on building for one of my firends. It is in an extremely rough state, and is only added to this post as a showcase of the blogs functionality.
